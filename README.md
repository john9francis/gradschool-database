# Development Environment

The code for this project will primarily be written in Python using Visual Studio Code. The libraries I will be using are found in the requirements.txt file. To run this project on your own machine, clone the repository and then you can run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and it will automatically install all the libraries that I have used.
